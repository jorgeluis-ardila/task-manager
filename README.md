## Overview

![overview](https://github.com/jorgeluis-ardila/task-manager/blob/featured-app/src/assets/oveview-task-manager.jpg)

You can find the demo [here](http://jorgeardila.co/task-manager/). This was my first project with ReactJS the base was the [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hH6PbOHBdPm6otzw2De5) from Devchallenges.io, I add some features and also made my own design. In this project I used the state, effect, events and context from React in order to learn the bases and principles of it.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a solution to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hH6PbOHBdPm6otzw2De5) was to build an application to complete the following user stories (I add and modify some of the user stories).

**User stories**
- I can add a new task
- I can complete a task
- I can delete a task
- I can search a task
- I can toggle between All, Active and Completed
- I can remove all tasks under the Completed tab
- Store the data in local storage that when I refresh the page I can still see my progress
